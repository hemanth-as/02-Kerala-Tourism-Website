Munnar is a town and hill station in the Idukki district of the southwestern Indian state of Kerala. Munnar is situated at around 1,600 metres (5,200 ft) above mean sea level, 
        in the Western Ghats mountain range. Munnar is also called the "Kashmir of South India" and is a popular honeymoon destination.
        The region has been inhabited by hunter-gatherer tribals like the Malayarayan and Muthuvan for thousands of years.Tradition states that Colonel Arthur Wellesley, later the 
        Duke of Wellington, was the first British person to pass through Munnar during Tippu Sultan's campaign in Travancore, but this is unsubstantiated. The first survey of the terrain 
        was undertaken by Benjamin Swayne Ward in 1816-1817, who followed the Periyar into the Western Ghats and established a camp at the confluence of three rivers, from which the name 
        of Munnar is derived.
