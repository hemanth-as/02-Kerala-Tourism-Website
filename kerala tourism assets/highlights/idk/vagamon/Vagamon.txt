Vagamon (Malayalam: വാഗമൺ) is an Indian hill station and a revenue village primarily located in Peerumedu taluk of Idukki district (majority area including Vagamon town), and also Meenachil taluk and Kanjirappally taluk of Kottayam district in the state of Kerala, India.
Vagamon does not have a long history to boast of as it had remained unexplored for centuries. Though the British had plantations here, it was only in 1926, when Walter Duncan and Company started their tea plantations here, that it became well-known. In the 1930s, more tea plantations were set up in the area.After 1940 people from Travancore mostly from southern Travancore and people from Madras (Tamil Nadu) migrated to Vagamon.Later after the formation of Kerala State people from various parts of Kerala have migrated there.

In the 1950s, the famed Kurisumala Ashram was set up here and that was the turning point in its development into a well-known place.

National Geographic Traveler has listed Vagamon on their directory of the "50 most attractive places to visit in India".[
