      <p>Beypore or Beypur is an ancient port town and a locality town in Kozhikode district in the state of Kerala, India. It is located opposite to Chaliyam, 
        the estuary where the river Chaliyar empties into Arabian Sea. Beypore is part of Kozhikode Municipal Corporation. The place was formerly known as Vaypura / Vadaparappanad 
        and also as Beydary. Tippu Sultan, ruler of Mysore, named the town "Sultan Pattanam". There is a marina and a beach while Beypore port is one of the oldest ports in Kerala, 
        which historically traded with the Middle East. Beypore is noted for building wooden ships, known as dhows or urus in the Malayalam language. These ships were usually bought 
        by Arab merchants for trading and fishing but are now used as tourist ships. According to Captain Iwata, founder member of the Association of Sumerian ships in Japan, Sumerian 
        ships might have been built in Beypore. There is evidence to prove that Beypore had direct trade links with Mesopotamia and was a prominent link on the maritime silk route. 
        The first railway line of Kerala was laid in 1861 from Tirur to Beypore (Chaliyam) passing through Tanur, Parappanangadi, Vallikkunnu, and Kadalundi.
        Beypore is located 10 km (6.2 mi) away from Kozhikode city.</p>
