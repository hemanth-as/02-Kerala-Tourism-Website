Kappad, or Kappakadavu locally, is a beach and village near Koyilandy, in the district Kozhikode, Kerala, India. Kappad beach, a tranquil setting for a relaxed getaway, is located about 16 km from Kozhikode town. The beach occasionally visited by tourists, is quiet except when the fishermen launch their boats at dawn and in the evening when they return with their catch.
